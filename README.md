# YouTube Study Time Tracker Extension

A Chrome extension that helps you track and manage your study time vs fun time while watching YouTube videos. The extension automatically classifies videos based on your study area and enforces fun time limits to improve productivity.

## Features

- **Automatic Video Classification**: Classifies YouTube videos as study or fun based on category and your study area
- **Time Tracking**: Tracks study time and fun time separately with daily and total statistics
- **Fun Time Limits**: Enforces limits on fun video watching based on your study time
- **Video Blocking**: Automatically blocks videos when fun time limit is exceeded
- **YouTube Theme**: Beautiful UI that matches YouTube's design
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Background service worker continuously monitors video activity
- **User Classification**: Allows manual classification when automatic detection is uncertain

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Build the extension**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Load the extension in Chrome**:
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `public` folder from this project

## Setup

1. **First-time setup**: When you first open the extension, you'll be prompted to:
   - Select your study area (Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, etc.)
   - Set your fun time limit (minutes per hour of study)
   - Enable/disable notifications

2. **Optional**: Add a YouTube API key for better video classification:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   - Create a new project and enable YouTube Data API v3
   - Generate an API key and add it in the extension settings

## How It Works

### Video Detection
- The extension automatically detects when you're watching YouTube videos
- It monitors video playback state (playing, paused, ended)
- Tracks tab visibility to only count time when you're actively viewing

### Classification System
- **Study Videos**: Educational content related to your study area
- **Fun Videos**: Entertainment content not related to your studies
- **Unknown**: Videos that need manual classification

### Time Tracking
- **Study Time**: Time spent watching educational videos
- **Fun Time**: Time spent watching entertainment videos
- **Fun Time Limit**: Calculated as `(study time in hours Ã— limit) + 10 minutes base allowance`

### Video Blocking
- When fun time limit is exceeded, videos are automatically blocked
- A blocking overlay appears with a message
- Videos can be unblocked by closing the overlay

## Usage

1. **Browse YouTube normally** - the extension works in the background
2. **Check your stats** - click the extension icon to see your dashboard
3. **Classify videos** - when prompted, choose if a video is study or fun related
4. **Manage settings** - adjust your study area, time limits, and preferences
